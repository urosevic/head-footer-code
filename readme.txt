Easy add site-wide and/or article specific custom code before the closing &lt;/head&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;, or opening &lt;body&gt; tag.

== Description ==

Let we say that you have been told to add some custom code (HTML, JavaScript or CSS style) to page's `<head>` (like site verification code, custom styles, webfont link, etc), just before `</body>` or right after opening `<body>` (like pixel tracking, analytics code, heatmap code, etc), but you are not programmer. Then you can use Head &amp; Footer Code to do that.

Simply go to Tools &rarr; Head &amp; Footer Code in your website admin dashboard, and insert custom code to HEAD, BODY or FOOTER section (depending what you have to do).

If your WordPress show latest blog posts on homepage, you can also add specific code only for homepage on **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code** (there will be section **Head, body and footer code on Homepage in Blog Posts mode**)

If you have to insert some custom code specific for individual article (post, page, custom post type), then you can use Article specific metabox while you editing post/page/custom post type (check out [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-footer-code/#screenshots)). There you can also set should that specific code be appended to site-wide code defined on **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code**, or should be overwritten.

Please note that taxonomies does not have own specific code but global code is added on those pages (category, tag and custom taxonomy listing, individual category, tags and custom taxonomies).

This magic is done by hooking to WordPress hooks `wp_head`, `wp_footer` and `wp_body_open`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why another one custom code plugin? =

Because all other similar plugins could not satisfy my requirements. In general, they have too much features or lack some features I need.

= I entered code to BODY section but nothing output on front-end =

This feature is implemented since WordPress version 5.2, but also require compatibility theme. Make sure that your theme support [wp_body_open](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_body_open/) hook.

Open in code editor `header.php` file from theme you use, and check if right after opening `<BODY>` tag there is following code (if it does not exists, add it or ask some developer to do that for you):
```if ( function_exists( 'wp_body_open' ) ) {
    wp_body_open();
}```
