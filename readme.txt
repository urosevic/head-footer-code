Easy add site-wide, category and article specific custom code before the closing &lt;/head&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;, or after opening &lt;body&gt; tag.


## Description

**Head &amp; Footer Code** plugin helps you add custom code snippets (JavaScript, CSS, or HTML) to the page even if you are not a programmer. It could be within the `<head>` (site verification code for various services, custom styles, meta or Webfont link), right after opening `<body>` (pixel tracking, analytics or heatmap code) or just before closing `</body>` tag.

Go to **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code** in WordPress Dashboard. Insert custom code to HEAD, BODY or FOOTER section (depending on what you have to do).

All magic is done by hooking to WordPress hooks `wp_head`, `wp_footer` and `wp_body_open`.

### Homepage in Blog Posts mode

If your WordPress shows the latest blog posts on the homepage, you can also add specific code only for the homepage on **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code** (there will be section **Head, body and footer code on Homepage in Blog Posts mode**)


### Article specific code

To insert custom code specific for individual article (post, page or custom post type), use article-specific Metabox while editing post/page/custom post type (check out [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-footer-code/#screenshots)). There choose if that specific code appends to site-wide code defined on **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code**, or to replace it.


### Category specific code

You can also define a Category specific code on each individual category.

Other taxonomies (tag and custom taxonomy) do not have available their specific code, but for them a Global code is used instead.

### Data stored in database

Each post/page/custom post type specific HEAD, BODY and FOOTER code and behaviour saves to post meta `_auhfc`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### On Network WordPress an Administrator/Editor/Author user getting code validation hint error `Tag <tag> is not allowed.`

It's not a bug, it's a security measure by WordPress Core.

If you wish to remove hinting errors for Administrator role, make sure you allow `unfiltered_html` capability for that role (Google is your friend).

### Is supported PHP code in code snippets?

As it's a security risk, the **Head &amp; Footer Code** does not process PHP code if entered into any plugin field (global or article specific).

Any content added to HFC fields is printed on the front-end as is.

### I entered code to BODY section, but nothing outputs on front-end

This feature is implemented since WordPress version 5.2 and requires theme compatibility.

To make sure if theme you use supports [wp_body_open](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_body_open/) hook, open in code editor `header.php` file from theme you use, and check if right after opening `<BODY>` tag there is following code (if it does not exists, add it or ask some developer to do that for you):

`
if ( function_exists( 'wp_body_open' ) ) {
    wp_body_open();
}
`
